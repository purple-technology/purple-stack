# Purple Stack - Domain Integration Rules

## Adding a New Domain with Web Routes/Components

When creating a new domain that exports web routes or components (anything imported by the `web` package), you MUST complete these integration steps:

### 1. Add Domain Dependency to Web Package

Add the domain package to `web/package.json` dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@purple-stack/{domain-name}": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

### 2. Add TypeScript References

Add the domain to TypeScript references in TWO places:

**a) `web/tsconfig.json`:**
```json
{
  "references": [
    { "path": "../domains/{domain-name}" }
  ]
}
```

**b) Root `tsconfig.json`:**
```json
{
  "references": [
    { "path": "./domains/{domain-name}" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run `pnpm install` from the project root to install the new dependency and create workspace symlinks.

### Why This Is Required

Without these steps, Vite will fail to resolve imports from the domain package with errors like:
```
Failed to resolve import "@purple-stack/{domain-name}/web/routes" from "src/App.tsx"
```

This happens because:
- Vite needs the package to be listed in `package.json` dependencies to resolve workspace packages
- TypeScript needs the reference for proper type checking and module resolution

### 4. Add Domain Dependency to Root Package (for API/Infra)

If the domain exports API routes (used by `infra/src/apiHandler.ts`), add it to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@purple-stack/{domain-name}": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

This is required because SST bundles Lambda functions from the root and needs workspace dependencies listed here.

### Checklist

When adding a new domain with web exports:
- [ ] Domain package.json has correct exports configured
- [ ] Domain added to `web/package.json` dependencies
- [ ] Domain added to `web/tsconfig.json` references
- [ ] Domain added to root `tsconfig.json` references
- [ ] Domain added to root `package.json` devDependencies (if exporting API)
- [ ] `pnpm install` run successfully
- [ ] Domain router registered in `infra/src/apiHandler.ts` (if exporting API)
- [ ] Routes registered in `web/src/App.tsx` (if exporting routes)
- [ ] Navigation links added (if needed)
